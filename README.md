# Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)

This repository contains an implementation and analysis of **[Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290)**, a high-performance and lightweight technique for aligning large language models with human preferences.

This project explores the DPO algorithm as a modern alternative to traditional Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
